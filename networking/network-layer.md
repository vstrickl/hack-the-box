# The Network Layer

## 2 Functions the Network Layer is Responsible for
- Logical Addressing
- Routing

## Objective
- Controls the exchange of [data packets](./data-packets.md)
- Identifies the individual network nodes
- Sets up and clears connection channels
- Takes care of routing and data flow control
- Evaluated the addresses when sending the data packets
- Data is routed through the network from node to node
- Routing and the construction of routing tables are done based on the addresses
- Ensures the routing of packets from source to destination within or outside a subnet

# Most Used Protocols on the Network Layer
- IPv4 / IPv6
- IPsec
- ICMP
- IGMP
- RIP
- OSPF

*** *Forwarded packets do not reach the higher layers but are assigned a new intermediate destination and sent to the next node.*
