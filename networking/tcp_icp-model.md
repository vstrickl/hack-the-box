# TCP/ICP Model

## Definition
TCP/IP model, often referred to as the Internet Protocol Suite, is a protocol family that represents many protocols that are responsible for the switching and transport of data packets on the Internet.
- TCP/IP = Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
- Provides the necessary functions for transporting and switching data packets in a private or public network
- Allows hosts to connect to the Internet
    - The Internet is entirely based on the TCP/IP protocol family
- The IP part is located within Layer 3, the network layer of the OSI model
- The TCP part is located within Layer 4, the transport layer of the OSI layer model
- A way for Pen testers to quickly understand how the entire connection is established
