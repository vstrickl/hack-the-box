## SFTP
how is it be
- ask them why it is an issue
are they just 21 FTP - are they doing it with encryption
if they are doing 22 - 
- are they being exposed externally
    - grab common user names and common passwords and spam it

## MFA 
- spin up an engagement
- need to be behind sso/ad
- how many times can we attempt before the account is flagged logged in or blocked

## Retirement
- when are they going to shut it down
- are they willing to do any stop gaps

## Process
- Wrap and an enagement these things

## Words of Wisdom from Logan
- Start looking at working out what applictions are externally facing / functionality
- master list of these applications
- test on the external first
- Appsec we are the doorway in
- once I have a good grasp on the external then I can work on the internals
